                    <p class="who-text">After ten years of studying the human body first as a personal trainer then as a licensed massage therapist, Samantha Liu saw a powerful correlation between health and sexual intimacy.  With the objective of helping couples find and improve intimacy as a way of improving their well being, she opened Glass Kandi, an adult boutique with a focus on artistic glass dildos.  Glass Kandi was an instant success, yet Samantha turned down multiple acquisition and joint venture offers because she enjoyed being that neighborhood place where she could touch people’s lives and remain part of the feedback loop.  Seven years later, Glass Kandi is on the short list of high end, must see San Francisco boutique destinations.
                        <br><br>
                    As the key to true intimacy in sex lies with finding the right partner, Samantha’s next venture was a matchmaking makeover company, Samona Date.   While Glass Kandi gave Samantha unusual access to the sexual intimacy side of couple’s lives, with Samona Date Samantha got an up close look at the chemistry that goes into making a healthy and intimate couple.  She began to see ways to bring out or maximize the chemistry between two potential partners.
                    <br><br>
                    The culmination of everything Samantha learned about intimacy inspired Samantha to create Hush Intimacy Spaces.  Samantha believes that everyone should have a health sex life, and with that will come physical and mental health and stability.  A healthy and intimate sex life is something that is fragile and needs to be nurtured.  While toys and imagination are powerful tools, Samantha realized that having a room dedicated to intimacy is the penultimate accessory to keep couples on the right path. </p>

                    <p class="who-text">Craig Fossella has spent his career identifying opportunities to create new environments in the health and beauty field.  As a senior executive with a public laser company in the 1990’s, Craig successfully married medical services into a day spa, creating the first Medi-Spa.  
                        <br><br>
                    Fossella followed that up by taking Bliss from a single location day spa in New York City to an international powerhouse brand.  Bliss became perhaps the most well known spa brand in the world and was known as the leader of the spa boom because it brought spa services to the masses, due in large part to its friendly facilities and irreverent branding.

                    In 2003, he moved west to launch his own project, Tru in San Francisco.  Tru became not only the talk of San Francisco, but garnered a tremendous amount of national attention. Many of the Tru’s concepts that were revolutionary for the time are now standard in the spa industry.  Fossella is also the owner of Bare, an upscale waxing boutique in the Marina district of San Francisco. </p>
