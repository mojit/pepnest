                    <p class="why-text">Sex is not an issue with couples until its bad, too infrequent, or has ceased altogether.  Then it becomes a very significant issue, one that can lead to frustration, arguments, and resentment.  This in turn makes intimacy that much harder to achieve, creating a vicious cycle.  A poor sex life almost always takes the relationship down with it.  By contrast, a healthy and happy sex life is one of the cornerstones of a great and enduring relationship.

                     <br><br>

                    Perhaps more than anything else in a relationship, maintaining an exciting sex life is hard work.  In today’s complex world, we need all the help we can get to keep it fresh and exciting.  Besides a vivid imagination, what more powerful weapon could one have in the arsenal than a dedicated space equipped with tools, toys, and turn ons?

                     <br><br>

                    While the bedroom should be a sanctuary, all too often its where we think about (and most profoundly feel) life’s pressures.  Many of these pressures – worrying about work, money, the relationships, children – are often cited as reasons for decreased libido.  The bedroom could also be where many sensitive topics are discussed and may have been the home to arguments.  Even for couples with the best sex lives, the bedroom is simply a place, usually very little about which enhances the desire, passion, or experience.  Which stands to reason, since bedrooms are usually not designed as play spaces, but rather around comfort, storage efficiency, and the ability to provide a good night’s sleep.

                     
                    <br><br>
                    Sex in itself is an escape, and as such it thrives in an environment that also removes us from our everyday lives.  Hush Intimacy rooms are truly a sanctuary from the outside world.  Their whole purpose is to foster, promote, and enhance sex by being designed and equipped based on the desires and turn ons of an individual or couple.</p>
